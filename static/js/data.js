        "Summary": "Inspired by salty-crunchy Sichuan dry-fried string beans (gan bian si ji dou), these green beans are shriveled and browned into delicious submission before receiving a flavor bomb of garlic, red pepper flakes, and chopped capers at the very end. Resist the urge to stir the beans around in the pan, and let them take on color like you would ground meat. Patience is essential here.",
        "Ingredients": "['⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil', '1 lb. green beans, trimmed, patted dry of any surface moisture or condensation', 'Kosher salt', '6 garlic cloves, sliced', '1 Tbsp. capers, drained, chopped', '1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes']",
        "Instructions": "['Heat oil in a large skillet over high until shimmering. Add green beans (the dryer they are, the less they will spatter when they hit the oil) and cook, covering skillet as needed if beans are spattering, until browned underneath, about 3 minutes. Turn beans with tongs and redistribute so they brown evenly (don’t toss them since hot oil can easily slosh out of skillet if you try to show off). Continue to cook, turning occasionally, until browned all over and tender, about 5 minutes longer. Season with salt. Add garlic, capers, and red pepper flakes. Cook, tossing occasionally, just until garlic turns golden, about 1 minute.', 'Transfer beans to a platter. Spoon caper-garlic mixture over and pour some oil over too; season with salt.']",

        "Summary": "Risotto is like a clingy baby. You can’t put it down, you can’t walk away from it, and you can’t ignore it. Its needs are simple, it just wants all of you. And if you give it all of your patient attention, it will turn into a puddle of love. This simple, pure, unadulterated version stands up on its own, but it also makes an excellent canvas for seasonal ingredients—find out more about those toppings below. This is part of BA’s Best, a collection of our essential recipes.",
        "Ingredients": "['1 Tbsp. kosher salt, plus more', '6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '½ large white onion, finely chopped (about 1½ cups)', '2 cups carnaroli or Japanese sushi rice', '1 cup dry white wine', '5 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces', '1¾ cups finely grated Parmesan, divided', 'Freshly ground black pepper']",
        "Instructions": "['Combine 1 Tbsp. salt and 10 cups water in a medium stockpot. Bring to a very bare simmer over medium heat.', 'Meanwhile, heat oil in a 6-qt. Dutch oven over medium. Cook onion and a pinch of salt, stirring frequently, until onion is translucent and starting to soften, 6–8 minutes. Add ½ cup water and cook, stirring often, until water evaporates and onion is sizzling in oil and completely tender, about 5 minutes. (Adding the water allows the onion to cook gently and thoroughly without taking on any color.) Taste onion; if it’s still firm at all, add another splash of water and continue cooking until meltingly soft.', 'Add rice and stir well to coat with oil. Cook, stirring constantly, until grains of rice are translucent around the edges and they make a glassy clattering sound when they hit the sides and bottom of pot, about 5 minutes. Coating the grains with oil before adding any liquid helps the rice cook evenly so that the outside does not become mushy before the center is tender. Add wine and another pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine is completely evaporated, about 2 minutes.', 'Reduce heat to medium, then add hot salted water to rice in ¾-cup increments, stirring constantly and allowing liquid to absorb fully before adding more, until rice is al dente and surrounded by fluid, not-too-thick creamy suspension, 25–30 minutes. It should take 2–3 minutes for each addition to be absorbed; if things are moving faster than this, reduce heat to medium-low. Gradual absorption and constant agitation are key to encouraging the starches to release from the risotto, creating its trademark creamy consistency. You may not need all of the hot water, but err on the side of soup rather than sludge. The finished texture should be more of a liquid than a solid. Start checking the rice after about 15 minutes; the grains should be tender but not mushy, with a slightly firm center that doesn’t leave a chalky or bitty residue between your teeth after tasting. Do not overcook!', 'Remove pot from heat, add butter, and stir until melted. Gradually add 1¼ cups Parmesan, stirring until cheese is melted and liquid surrounding risotto is creamy but very fluid. Stir in more hot salted water if needed to achieve the right consistency. Taste and season with salt.', 'Divide risotto among warm bowls. Top each with a grind of pepper.

Vigorously stirring the pasta with a wooden spoon as soon as it hits the sauce.

Cook, tossing often and adding Parmesan little by little, until cheese is melted and sauce is creamy, about 3 minutes. If sauce looks tight, add 1–2 Tbsp. pasta cooking liquid. (Cream sauces tighten up very quickly as they cool, so it’s better to lean on the saucier side of things.) Stir in reserved lemon juice; season with more salt, if needed.', 'Divide pasta among bowls.

Using tongs, hold a steak perpendicular to grill and sear bone side and fat-cap side to render some of the fat, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining steaks. Insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of each steak; if it registers 120° for rare (steaks will carry over to 125°, or medium-rare, as they rest), they’re done. If they’re not quite there, continue to cook over indirect heat—another 2–4 minutes should do it. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 20 minutes before slicing against the grain.', 'Meanwhile, heat ¼ cup oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over high heat. As soon as oil starts to smoke, add peppers to cover bottom of pan in a single layer (don’t crowd). Cook, tossing occasionally, until blistered in spots but still green, about 3 minutes.

        "Summary": "At Pirelli's restaurant in Rome, chef Barbara Lynch ate what was, for her, the perfect carbonara: The sauce was bright yellow from fresh eggs, and each rigatoni hid cubes of fatty guanciale. In Boston, where Lynch has five restaurants, she set out to master the dish. Her yolk-heavy recipe is beyond creamy—without cream!—with a heady mix of peppercorns (you can substitute black pepper for all and it's still great). It's unlike any clumpy carbonaras you've had. The tricks? She omits most of the egg whites; their water thins the sauce. Too much cheese overthickens it, so she gradually adds Pecorino while tossing the pasta until she hits the right consistency (the sauce should be loose enough to drag the pasta through). Lynch was right: It's a pasta worth mastering. This is part of BA's Best, a collection of our essential recipes.",

The dough should still be somewhat crumbly; I recommend squeezing a small amount of dough between your fingers; it should stick together well, but if it doesn’t and is very crumbly, add more ice water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, until it just comes together. If your dough is too wet, add flour 1/2 tablespoon until it comes together. I usually don’t mess with ratios too much because this is what works for me. Do not overwork the dough. ', ' Place dough onto a well-floured surface and form into a disk shape, then wrap with plastic wrap or in a reusable bag. Chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 days. Dough can also be frozen for up to 2-3 months if well wrapped in both plastic and then foil.

Fold dough in half to help transfer to place in pie plate. Unfold and ease the dough into the pan. (If you mess up, that’s completely okay — just reshape the dough into a disk and roll out again.) Trim the extra crust around the edges of the pie plate and discard excess dough. Flute the edges of the crust however you’d like (I normally use my finger and thumb to pinch the dough or you can use a fork!). Cover the pie crust tightly with plastic wrap and place pie pan in the refrigerator while you prepare your pie filling. Makes 1 pie crust. Feel free to double the recipe to make a double pie crust.

        "Instructions": "[' Warm milk to around 110 degrees F. I like to do this by placing milk in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving it for 45 seconds. It should be like warm bath water. Transfer warm milk and sugar to the bowl of an electric mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Stir pumpkin puree, room temperature egg and melted butter, mixing until smooth and well combined and creamy. Next stir in bread flour, pumpkin pie spice and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form. ', ' Place dough hook on mixer and knead dough on low speed for 8-10 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. (If you don’t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface.) ', ' Transfer dough ball to a large bowl greased with olive oil or nonstick cooking spray, then cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size.

You will probably need to cut off about an inch off the ends of the dough as the ends won’t be as full of cinnamon sugar as we’d want it to be. Then cut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife. You should get 12 rolls. I like to make dents in the dough before cutting as demonstrated in the photos, to make 12 even rolls. ', ' Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x13 inch baking pan. I highly recommend lining the pan with parchment paper as well, in case any of the filling ends up leaking out. Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let the cinnamon rolls rise again for about 30 minutes, then preheat your oven. ', ' Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake the cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. You want to under bake them a little so they stay soft in the middle, that’s why we want them just slightly golden brown. Allow them to cool for 10 minutes before frosting. Makes 12 cinnamon rolls ', ' To make the frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer or in a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, maple syrup and salt. Beat until smooth. Spread over the pumpkin cinnamon rolls and serve! Sprinkle cinnamon rolls with a little cinnamon for a pretty look. Enjoy! ']",

Sprinkle each bowl with about 1/3 cup shredded cheese. Broil until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Make sure you are watching very carefully! Serve immediately. Makes 6 servings ']",
