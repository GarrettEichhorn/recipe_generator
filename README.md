[Recipe Generator](https://garretteichhorn.github.io/recipe_generator/)

This application was created to make Sunday meal planning easier! Gone are the days of traversing the internet for recipes using
vague search criteria, inundated by too-many choices and irrelevant results. I grabbed recipes from my favorite online providers 
and amalgamated them for quick retrieval to generate recipe ideas for the week.

-----

This app scrapes data from several popular recipe websites...

* [Bon App√©tit](https://www.bonappetit.com/)
    ** Scraped with BS4 via Splinter (abstract layer for Selenium)  
* [Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/)
    ** Scraped with BS4 via Scrapy  
* [Ambitious Kitchen](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/)
    ** Scraped with BS4 via requests  

... and amalgamates the data for quick retrieval via website (linked above).

Each website is scraped with a different methodology to demonstrate functional expertise!

The app processes text and administers custom search for tailored results.
